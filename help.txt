example of command line argument:
python3.7 mutationList.py -i pdb.pdb -r "15-17(mi)" -o output.txt  



-i		user input, which is in the form of a pdb file

-r		user range of mutation. Could be in the following formats

		possible examples for -r argument:
		"AUTO": pipeline choses the two most flexible sites based on B-factor value
		        calculated by ENCOM, then pipeline substitute those positions to 
		        groups c and m (more information about c and m in the group section)
		1-25: the positions 1 to 25 to all amino acids
		7,8,15-21(x): positions 7 and 8 and 15 to 21, 15 to 21 without WT
		7(RLTF),8(VS): for mentoined position number 
				only mutate to given Amino Acid in the paranthesis
				Amino Acid is written with capital letter and SINGLE LETTER FORMAT.
		6(p): for position 6 mutate to all polar Amino acids.
		
			The group of amino Acids are written with small letters
			the groups can be:
			p: polar: N(ASN),Q(GLN),R(ARG),K(LYS),D(ASP),E((GLU),H(HIS)  
			h: hydrophobe: A(ALA),I(ILE),L(LEU),M(MET),F(PHE),V(VAL),W(TRP),C(CYS) 
			-: negative: D(ASP),E(GLU)
			+: positive: K(LYS),R(ARG),H(HIS)
			l: large: W(TRP),F(PHE),H(HIS),Y(TYR),R(ARG),K(LYS) 
			s: small: G(GLY),A(ALA),D(ASP),C(CYS),S(SER) 
			a: aromatique: F(PHE),Y(TYR),W(TRP),H(HIS)
			i: closest substitution in terms of isoelectric point (format<WT:substitution residue>)
			   AL,LI,RK,KR,NF,MS,DE,FN,CN,PI,QY,SY,ED,TY,YT,GV,WV,HP,IL,VG
			c: closest substitution in terms of chemical distance
			   AP,RK,ND,DN,CS,QH,EQ,GP,HQ,IL,LI,KA,MV,FI,PG,SR,TP,WY,YI,VM
			m: closest substitution in terms of 1 PAM evolutionary distance
			   AS,RK,NS,DE,CS,QE,ED,GA,HQ,IV,LV,KR,ML,FY,PA,SA,TS,WR,YF,VI
			x: to not mutate to WT (with no x it will mutate to WT as default)

-o		complete name of output file(should contain .txt)

-h		help
